Description: This package automates loading and cleaning IPUMS Multinational Time Use Survey (MTUS) 
            data for time use and travel analysis. IPUMS is a collection of research-oriented
            census and survey data hosted by the University of Minnesota. The main data-cleaning 
            function was based on a procedure written by Prof. Carole Voulgaris (Harvard University 
            Graduate School of Design), and the remainder of the package was written by 
            Patrick Braga (Harvard Master in Urban Planning '20).
